This repository contains opinionated, batteries-included .NET template(s) for Umbraco, designed to streamline the setup of new Umbraco projects. It aim to provide a solid foundation for developers working with Umbraco CMS.

## Features

- Pre-configured .NET template(s) for Umbraco
- Optimized project structure, with a high focus separation by feature
- Easy installation and usage

## Available Templates

The templates are orchestrated with .NET Aspire for a ready-to-go developer experience

- `umbraco-headless-bff` - This is the main template which contains both a CMS project and a BFF Api layer

## Installation

To install the templates, run the following command:

```sh
 dotnet new install MiguelGuedelha.Umbraco.Templates
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can create a new project with the usual .NET template syntax, such as:

```sh
 dotnet new <template-name> -n MyUmbracoProject
```

Replace `<template-name>` with the specific template name you wish to use.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to improve the templates, feel free to submit a pull request.

### Notes

- Ensure you have .NET SDK 10+ installed.
- These templates are maintained and versioned alongside Umbraco versioning.
  - MiguelGuedelha.Umbraco.Templates::17.x.x -> Umbraco 17
  - etc...
- Minors and patch versions might not align with Umbraco versions though, as there's a lot more dependencies associated with this package besides Umbraco
- I've started to mark V13 versions of the package as deprecated, as I have no plans in maintaining these anymore with the new LTS around the corner
- Due to an initial naming oopsie, V17+ versions will live under `MiguelGuedelha.Umbraco.Templates`, while the v13 versions will live in the original `MiguelGuedelha.UmbracoTemplates` space
- Feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated!

Happy coding!
